===================
Child Protection Information Network is dealing with various instances of duplicate records. Provided with 30,000 records. The task involed merging duplicates records in an unsupervised way and creating a supervised learning model on the merged records.

EDA: Contains code useed to perform Exploratory Data Analysis
Record Linkage: Code used to link over 10,000 records (99.2%)
Random Forrest Classifer: Supervised learning method chosen, namely due to its high explainability. Trained on a goldem sample from 10,000 merged records
Classifer trained w random sample: Supervised learning method chosen, namely due to its high explainability. Trained on a random sample from 10,000 merged records
